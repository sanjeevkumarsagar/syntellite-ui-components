# Project Brief: Syntellite UI Components Library

## Project Overview
**@syntellite/ui-components** is a comprehensive React UI component library built by Syntellite Innovations Private Limited for faster development across all client projects. The library provides reusable, highly customizable components with advanced styling capabilities, animations, and complete TypeScript support.

## Core Requirements

### Primary Goals
1. **Accelerate Development**: Provide ready-to-use components that reduce development time across client projects
2. **Consistency**: Ensure visual and functional consistency across all Syntellite client applications
3. **Customization**: Enable dynamic styling through props without requiring CSS overrides
4. **Performance**: Optimize bundle size with tree shaking and ES modules
5. **Developer Experience**: Provide excellent TypeScript support and comprehensive documentation

### Key Features Required
- **Dynamic Styling**: Change colors, gradients, and styles through component props
- **Advanced Animations**: 10+ built-in animation variants using Framer Motion
- **TypeScript First**: Full type safety and IntelliSense support
- **Tailwind CSS Integration**: Utility-first styling with custom design tokens
- **Responsive Design**: Mobile-first approach with responsive utilities
- **Accessibility**: ARIA compliant with keyboard navigation support
- **Tree Shaking**: Optimized bundle size with ES modules
- **Compound Components**: Flexible component composition patterns

### Technical Requirements
- React 18+ compatibility
- TypeScript for type safety
- Tailwind CSS for styling
- Framer Motion for animations
- Rollup for bundling
- Storybook for documentation
- Jest for testing
- ESLint for code quality

### Target Users
- Syntellite development teams
- Client project developers
- External developers using Syntellite components

### Success Criteria
